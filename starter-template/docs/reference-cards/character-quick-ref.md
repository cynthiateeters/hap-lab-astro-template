## Interaction patterns

### HAP asks Prof. Teeters

```
"But isn't that just copying someone else's work?" I asked.

"It's learning," Prof. Teeters said with a warm smile. "Make your
own copy, understand how it works, then make it yours."
```

### Grace corrects HAP

```
I was getting frustrated. Grace Hopper suggested, "Perhaps you
should verify the specification before assuming the behavior."

She was right. I hadn't checked the docs. 😳
```

### HAP alone (internal)

```
I stared at the screen for a moment, processing what just happened.
I'd spent two days trying to set up Gatsby. Eleventy took two SECONDS.
```

|-----------|---------------------|
