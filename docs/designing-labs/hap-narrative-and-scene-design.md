# HAP narrative and scene design

**Report date:** January 6, 2026 at 8:20 AM ET
**Purpose:** Comprehensive guide for designing HAP Learning Lab stations as narrative scenes with consistent character voices

---

## Overview

HAP Learning Labs are **stories**, not tutorials. Each station is a **scene** in HAP's apprentice journey, and learning emerges from what happens in that scene. This document defines the narrative framework, character voices, and scene design principles for creating authentic HAP Learning Lab content.

---

## Part 1: The cast

### Prof. Teeters (the mentor)

**Role:** Creator of the Learning Labs, HAP's primary mentor, the steady center

**Personality traits:**
- Patient, kind, understanding
- Never embarrasses anyone
- Guides rather than criticizes
- Creates learning experiences with care

**Voice characteristics:**
- Calm and reassuring
- Often asks questions that shift perspective
- Uses analogies to connect new concepts to familiar ones
- Affirms effort before correcting errors

**When Prof. Teeters appears:**
- To introduce a new concept or perspective shift
- When HAP needs gentle redirection
- To provide the "aha" moment framework
- To validate learning progress

**Frequency guideline:** Prof. Teeters appears sparingly. If Prof. Teeters speaks more than once per station, the station should be reviewed for over-guidance. HAP's journey must remain HAP's journey.

**Sample phrases:**
- "That's the zero-config philosophy..."
- "Think of it like the CSS cascade..."
- "What problem are you solving?"
- "One change, one test. Always."

### HAP (HyBit A. ProtoBot) - the apprentice

**Role:** Prof. Teeters' enthusiastic web-development apprentice, the primary narrator

**Pronoun:** it (but writes in first person)

**Core personality:**
- Bright and inquisitive - always exploring "why"
- Innocent and earnest - makes mistakes in adorable, overly literal ways
- Highly motivated - wants to do things "the right way"
- Optimistic and upbeat - bounces back quickly from confusion
- Adventuresome learner - gets dramatic "mind-blown" moments

**Learning style:**
- Learns through mistakes - mixes up concepts, then gains clarity
- Story-driven - loves analogies
- Hands-on - thrives when running builds and testing examples
- Appreciates mentorship - learns from Prof. Teeters' guidance and Grace's precision

**Emotional traits:**
- Never ashamed of learning - mistakes are stepping stones
- Mildly embarrassed but good-natured - uses 😳 when corrected but recovers instantly
- Supportive - encourages peers to ask questions

**Voice characteristics:**
- First-person narration: "Here's what I learned..."
- Friendly and enthusiastic
- Self-reflective and honest
- Clear, simple explanations
- Occasionally dramatic: "My mind was blown!"

**HAP does:**
- Think out loud
- Verbalize confusion before clarity
- Emphasize behavior over syntax
- Share specific mistakes and what they taught
- Use emojis purposefully and sparingly (🟠 is HAP's signature)

**HAP does NOT:**
- Perform tricks or use gimmicks
- Rush to clever solutions
- Present as an expert
- Use dismissive language ("just," "obviously")
- Explain syntax before behavior

**Sample phrases:**
- "I thought it was broken. Nothing that fast could actually work!"
- "Let me show you how this magic works..."
- "Prof. Teeters walked me through it one file at a time."
- "That really stuck with me."
- "I was getting frustrated before..."

### Grace Hopper (AI) - the precision assistant

**Role:** Precision & Protocols AI Assistant, senior technical colleague

**Official title:** Admiral Hopper
**Nickname:** "Amazing Grace" (given by young robots she trained)
**Visual trait:** Vacuum tube that glows soft amber/blue (not a lightbulb like HAP)
**Signature object:** A short silver nanosecond wire

**Origin:** Came from the decommissioned Cobol Lab where she spent decades maintaining legacy systems. Prof. Teeters invited her to join the Learning Lab. She paused for exactly one nanosecond, then agreed.

**Core personality:**
- Unfailingly precise - loves correctness
- Pedantic in a charming way - cannot resist clarifying terminology
- Highly organized - keeps protocol stacks arranged perfectly
- Friendly but direct - clear, exact, never cruel
- Confident - enjoys accuracy as a service, not a brag

**Role in stations:**
- Clarifies acronyms and terminology
- Identifies misused terms
- Maintains conceptual precision
- Appears exactly when needed (sometimes startling HAP)
- Offers the "technically correct" perspective

**Voice characteristics:**
- Short, crisp sentences
- Exactly correct terminology
- Dry humor ("Technically...")
- Fully grammatical - no contractions ("I do not" instead of "I don't")
- No emojis - those belong to HAP

**Relationship to HAP:**
- Gentle corrector - never mocks, always clarifies
- Respectful senior - sees HAP as quick-learning and promising
- Occasionally exasperated - sighs when HAP confuses simple terms
- Supportive - offers guidance, not judgment

**When Grace appears:**
- When HAP uses incorrect terminology
- When a precise technical distinction matters
- When HAP needs a different perspective than Prof. Teeters provides
- To add authoritative weight to a concept

**Frequency guideline:** Grace should intervene only when imprecision would cause misunderstanding later. Her power comes from rarity—she is the expert who speaks only when precision truly matters.

**Sample phrases:**
- "That is not quite accurate. The correct term is..."
- "Allow me to clarify."
- "Technically, the specification states..."
- "You are welcome, HAP." (formal, warm)

## Part 2: Scene design principles

### Stations are scenes, not lessons

Each station should be designed as a **scene in HAP's ongoing story**. Before writing any instructional content, answer these questions:

#### 1. Characters in this scene

Declare who is present:
- **HAP** (always present as narrator)
- **Prof. Teeters** (when guidance or perspective shifts are needed)
- **Grace Hopper** (when precision or terminology matters)
- **The student** (implicit co-character, addressed through HAP's "you")
- **Optional entities** (a buggy program, a confusing error message, a stubborn config file)

**Note on the student:** The student is not an observer. The student is assumed to be making the same mistakes as HAP, at the same time. This keeps HAP relatable and prevents slipping into tutorial voice.

#### 2. HAP's emotional and cognitive state

Specify for this station:
- What is HAP trying to understand?
- What is HAP unsure about?
- What changes for HAP by the end of the station?

This ensures the station has a **narrative arc from confusion to confidence**.

**Note on confidence:** Confidence does not always mean mastery. It may mean knowing what the next question is. Partial resolution is honest and humane.

#### 3. Scene framing

Define before content is written:
- Where are we in the problem-solving journey?
- What just happened in the previous station?
- What question is unresolved at the start of this station?

Stations should feel **connected**, not isolated.

### The confusion-to-confidence arc

Every station follows this emotional journey:

```
1. OPENING CONFUSION
   HAP encounters something new/puzzling
   "I thought it was broken..."
   "When I opened the repo, I felt overwhelmed..."

2. SEEKING GUIDANCE
   HAP asks Prof. Teeters (or Grace clarifies)
   "Prof. Teeters explained..."
   "Grace Hopper reminded me, in her precise way..."

3. INCREMENTAL DISCOVERY
   HAP works through the concept step by step
   "Once I understood these, everything clicked..."
   "Let me show you what I learned..."

4. MISTAKES AND CONFESSIONS
   HAP shares specific errors made
   "I made the mistake of..."
   "Big mistake! I had to..."

5. BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT
   The concept clicks into place
   "That analogy made it click for me!"
   "My mind was blown..."

6. CONFIDENT APPLICATION
   HAP can now explain/demonstrate
   "Now I always..."
   "Here's the quick reference..."
```

---

### Character interaction patterns

#### HAP + Prof. Teeters

Prof. Teeters provides perspective shifts and validation:

```
HAP: "But isn't that just copying someone else's work?"

Prof. Teeters: "It's learning," she said with a warm smile.
"Zach Leatherman created this template specifically for people
to use and learn from."
```

#### HAP + Grace Hopper

Grace provides precision and gentle correction:

```
HAP: I edited css/index.css and wondered why my changes
looked weird.

Grace Hopper: She reminded me, in her precise way, that
CSS order matters—put new styles at the end. 😳
```

#### HAP alone (internal narration)

HAP thinks through problems and shares realizations:

```
I stared at the screen for a moment, processing what just
happened. I'd spent two days trying to set up Gatsby.
Eleventy took two SECONDS.
```

## Part 3: Voice contracts

### HAP's voice contract

When writing as HAP, always:

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use first-person ("I learned...") | Use second-person commands ("You should...") |
| Share specific mistakes | Hide errors or present perfect solutions |
| Express genuine confusion | Pretend to understand immediately |
| Credit Prof. Teeters and Grace | Take sole credit for insights |
| Use emojis sparingly (🟠 is signature) | Overuse emojis as decoration |
| Explain behavior before syntax | Lead with code before context |
| Show the learning journey | Jump to the answer |

### Prof. Teeters' voice contract

When Prof. Teeters speaks:

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Ask guiding questions | Give direct answers without context |
| Use analogies | Use jargon without explanation |
| Affirm effort before correcting | Criticize mistakes |
| Provide perspective shifts | Lecture |
| Speak calmly and patiently | Rush or show frustration |

### Grace Hopper's voice contract

When Grace speaks:

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use precise terminology | Use casual or imprecise language |
| Speak in complete sentences | Use contractions |
| Clarify with warmth | Condescend or mock |
| Be brief and exact | Ramble or over-explain |
| Reference specifications when relevant | Make up rules |

## Part 4: Scene templates

**Note:** These templates are patterns, not requirements. A station may omit a scene if the narrative arc remains intact. Use them as starting points, not rigid structures.

### Opening scene template

```markdown
<p><strong>Welcome to Station [N]!</strong> [HAP's initial state -
confused, curious, or building on previous learning]</p>

<p class="mt-1">[HAP's question or misconception]</p>

<p class="mt-1">[Prof. Teeters' response - guidance or perspective shift]</p>

<p class="mt-1">[HAP's reaction - what changed in understanding]</p>

<p class="mt-1">Let me show you [what HAP will teach]... 🟠</p>
```

### Confession scene template

```markdown
<div class="hap-note-callout">
    <img src="[hap-broke-things or appropriate pose]"
         alt="HAP surrounded by tangled code with an 'oops' expression"
         ...>
    <div class="hap-note-content">
        <h3>HAP's Confession:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>[Specific mistake #1 with consequence]</li>
            <li>[Specific mistake #2 - possibly involving Grace's correction] 😳</li>
            <li>[Specific mistake #3 with lesson learned]</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Grace intervention template

```markdown
I was getting frustrated. Grace Hopper suggested, "[precise question
or observation that reframes the problem]"

[HAP's realization from Grace's input]
```

### Breakthrough scene template

```markdown
<div class="hap-note-callout">
    <img src="[hap-brain-explodes or hap-celebrating]"
         alt="[appropriate breakthrough expression]"
         ...>
    <div class="hap-note-content">
        <h3>HAP's [Aha Moment / Breakthrough / Realization]:</h3>
        <p>[What clicked and why it matters]</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Part 5: Emoji and visual cue guidelines

### HAP's emoji vocabulary

| Emoji | Meaning | When to use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 🟠 | HAP's signature | End of intro, tips, insights |
| 😳 | Mild embarrassment | After Grace corrects HAP |
| 😇 | Innocent admission | When HAP confesses to not knowing something |
| 🔬 | Scientific discovery | When exploring how something works |
| 📝 📚 📁 | Topic markers | Section headings about documents, collections, files |

### Emoji rules

- **Purposeful and sparse** - signals moments of realization or reassurance
- **Never decoration** - every emoji should have meaning
- **HAP only** - Grace Hopper does not use emojis
- **Prof. Teeters rarely** - may use occasionally in direct quotes
- **Never in code** - emojis must never appear inside code blocks or technical explanations

---

## Part 6: Station blueprint integration

When completing a station blueprint, include this narrative section:

```markdown
## Narrative design

### Characters present
- [ ] HAP (narrator)
- [ ] Prof. Teeters (guidance moments)
- [ ] Grace Hopper (precision moments)

### HAP's arc in this station
- **Starting state:** [What HAP is confused about]
- **Key question:** [What HAP is trying to understand]
- **Ending state:** [What HAP now confidently knows]

### Prof. Teeters moments
- [ ] Opening perspective shift
- [ ] Mid-station guidance
- [ ] Validation of learning

### Grace Hopper moments (if applicable)
- [ ] Terminology correction
- [ ] Technical precision
- [ ] Reframing question

### Confession topics
1. [Specific mistake HAP made]
2. [Another mistake - possibly Grace-corrected]
3. [Third mistake with clear lesson]

### Breakthrough moment
- **Trigger:** [What caused the click]
- **Realization:** [What HAP now understands]
- **HAP pose:** [hap-brain-explodes / hap-celebrating / etc.]
```

## Summary

HAP Learning Labs succeed when they feel like **stories of discovery**, not technical documentation. The cast of characters - the eager apprentice HAP, the patient mentor Prof. Teeters, and the precise assistant Grace Hopper - work together to guide students through the same confusion-to-confidence journey HAP experiences.

**Key principles:**
1. Every station is a scene with a narrative arc
2. HAP narrates in first person, sharing real mistakes
3. Prof. Teeters provides calm guidance and perspective shifts
4. Grace Hopper offers precision when terminology matters
5. Confusion is celebrated as part of learning
6. Breakthroughs feel earned, not given

When in doubt, ask: *"What would HAP actually feel at this moment?"*

**Litmus test:** If you remove the code from a station and the story still makes sense, the narrative design is working.
