# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with HAP Learning Lab template customization.

## Project overview

**HAP's Learning Lab Template** - A static HTML/CSS/JavaScript educational website template for creating 6-station learning experiences. HAP (HyBit A. ProtoBot™) is Prof. Teeters' apprentice who guides students through hands-on web development learning with his friendly first-person narrative.

This is a **pure HTML/CSS/JS project** with no build process, no frameworks, and zero npm dependencies (except optional Lighthouse CLI for batch testing).

## Template purpose

This repository provides infrastructure for creating new HAP Learning Labs on any topic. It includes:

- **8 Claude Skills** - Progressive validation and standards enforcement
- **5 Templates** - Station HTML (1-5 and 6), demo HTML, curriculum plan, easter egg data
- **Static Assets** - HAP design system CSS, syntax highlighting, easter egg system
- **Documentation** - Complete guides for customization

## Common development commands

### Local development

```bash
# Start local server (required for JSON loading to work)
live-server --port=3000

# Then open http://localhost:3000 in browser
```

**Important**: Direct file opening (`file://` protocol) won't work due to CORS restrictions on JSON loading for the easter egg feature.

### Testing with Lighthouse

**Recommended method**: Use the DevTools MCP server (Claude Code's built-in browser automation):

```bash
# Claude Code can test pages directly using MCP
# Ask: "Test this page with Lighthouse using DevTools MCP"
# Or: "Run accessibility audit on all stations"
```

**Alternative method**: Use Lighthouse npm package for batch testing:

```bash
# Install dependencies (one time only)
npm install

# Run Lighthouse CI on all pages
npm run lh:ci
```

**Performance targets**:

- Performance: ≥99/100
- Accessibility: 100/100
- Best Practices: 100/100
- SEO: 100/100

## Template architecture

### Zero dependencies approach

- **No build process**: Edit HTML/CSS/JS directly
- **No frameworks**: Pure vanilla JavaScript
- **No npm runtime dependencies**: Claude Code's DevTools MCP for testing (npm Lighthouse optional)
- **CDN delivery**: Images served via Cloudinary, fonts via Google Fonts
- **Progressive enhancement**: Works without JS (except easter egg)

## Customization workflow

### Step 1: Plan your curriculum

1. Read `templates/curriculum-plan-template.md`
2. Fill in all [PLACEHOLDER] sections
3. Save as `CONTENT-PLAN.md` in your new learning lab directory
4. Define 6 station topics that build progressively
5. Write HAP's struggles and learning moments in first-person

### Step 2: Set up Skills

Copy the `.claude/skills` directory to your new learning lab:

```bash
cp -r .claude ~/your-new-lab/.claude
```

Claude Code will automatically use these Skills for validation.

### Step 3: Copy static assets

```bash
cp -r css ~/your-new-lab/css
cp -r js ~/your-new-lab/js
cp -r data ~/your-new-lab/data
```

### Step 4: Customize templates

**For Stations 1-5**:

1. Copy `templates/station-template.html` → `stations/station[1-5].html`
2. Use your `CONTENT-PLAN.md` to fill in [PLACEHOLDER] content
3. Maintain HAP's first-person apprentice voice
4. Reference the `hap-voice` and `station-content` Skills

**For Station 6** (AI assistance - fixed structure):

1. Copy `templates/station6-template.html` → `stations/station6.html`
2. Station 6 ALWAYS teaches AI assistance for your topic
3. Follows fixed 12-section structure (cannot be customized)
4. Only customize [PLACEHOLDER] content, not structure

**For interactive demos**:

1. Copy `templates/demo-template.html` → `demos/[demo-name].html`
2. Use the `demo-builder` Skill for structure guidance
3. Implement JavaScript patterns documented in template
4. Test accessibility with `accessibility-check` Skill

**For easter eggs**:

1. Copy `templates/hybit-insights-template.json` → `data/hybit-insights.jsonc`
2. Define parameters for your topic
3. Write messages in HAP's voice
4. Test with `?hybit=[parameter]` in URLs

### Step 5: Validate with Skills

Before committing any code, run through these Skills:

- `hap-voice`: Validate HAP's first-person voice
- `accessibility-check`: Ensure WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance
- `css-standards`: Verify all colors use hsl() format
- `security-audit`: Check easter egg whitelist validation
- `testing-framework`: Run audits with DevTools MCP or Lighthouse (target: 99+/100)

## Claude Skills reference

### When to use each Skill

**Before writing ANY code**:

- `css-standards`: Consult before adding any CSS colors

**While creating content**:

- `hap-voice`: Validate HAP's personality and tone
- `station-content`: Ensure station structure is complete
- `demo-builder`: Build interactive demonstrations

**Before committing**:

- `accessibility-check`: Verify WCAG compliance
- `security-audit`: Validate security patterns
- `testing-framework`: Run performance tests

### How to use Skills

Claude Code automatically loads Skills from `.claude/skills/`. To use a Skill:

1. Read the Skill's `SKILL.md` file
2. Follow the progressive validation steps
3. Complete all checklists
4. Use provided code patterns

## HAP's voice guidelines

**Critical**: HAP always speaks in first-person apprentice voice.

**Correct patterns**:

- ✅ "I learned from Prof. Teeters that..."
- ✅ "When I was practicing..."
- ✅ "This was tricky for me too..."
- ✅ "Prof. Teeters showed me..."

**Incorrect patterns**:

- ❌ "You should..." (too instructional)
- ❌ "This tutorial teaches..." (not personal)
- ❌ "Obviously, the answer is..." (not humble)
- ❌ Generic statements without attribution

**HAP's personality**:

- Enthusiastic but humble
- References Prof. Teeters as mentor
- Shares mistakes and learning moments
- Uses "I" and "me", not "you" or "we"
- Makes complex topics relatable

See `hap-voice` Skill for complete guidelines.

## HAP image inventory

**IMPORTANT**: When adding HAP images to station content, ALWAYS consult the verified image inventory to prevent hallucination of non-existent images.

**Location**: `.claude/skills/hap-image-validation/hap-cloudinary-complete-inventory.md`

**What it contains**:

- 21 verified HAP images (complete list)
- Cloudinary URLs with version numbers
- Emotional categories (learning, confusion, breakthrough, success)
- Recommended alt text for each image
- Usage guidelines (when to use which pose)

**Before adding ANY HAP image**:

1. Open `.claude/skills/hap-image-validation/hap-cloudinary-complete-inventory.md`
2. Find image that matches content emotional context
3. Copy exact filename (e.g., `hap-laptop_xiewar`)
4. Copy exact version number (e.g., `v1759495998`)
5. Use recommended alt text from inventory
6. Verify emotional category matches your content

**Example workflow**:

```markdown
Content context: "HAP was confused about container queries..."
→ Check inventory → "Confusion category"
→ Use: hap-confused-map_q8q0ej (v1759495999)
→ Alt text: "HAP looking confused while studying a map"
```

**DO NOT**:

- ❌ Guess HAP image filenames
- ❌ Make up version numbers
- ❌ Use images not in the inventory
- ❌ Reuse breakthrough images too frequently (max 1-2 per station)

See `hap-image-validation` Skill for complete validation patterns.

## Content conventions

### Heading capitalization

**HTML files** (educational content): Use **title case**

- ✅ "The Resolution Problem"
- ✅ "Why Typography Matters"

**Markdown files** (technical docs): Use **sentence case**

- ✅ "The resolution problem"
- ✅ "Why typography matters"

### Emoji usage

**HAP's signature emoji**: 🟠 (orange circle) for tips and insights

**Approved emoji** (good visibility on cream background):

- 🟠 HAP's signature - use as safe alternative
- 🔬 Science, research, HAP's lab context
- 📊 Data, metrics
- 🎯 Goals, targets
- 🎨 Design, colors
- 🚀 Performance
- 🌐 Web, browsers
- 📸 Images
- 🗂️ Organization, systems
- 🎡 Relationships, cycles
- ♿ Accessibility

**Never use** (poor visibility):

- ❌ 💡 ⚡ ⭐ ✨ (yellow on cream = invisible)
- ❌ 🤖 (use HAP images instead)

### Markdown standards

**From user's global rules**:

- Headers: Sentence case, single space after `#`
- Lists: Use `-` exclusively (never `*` or `+`)
- Code blocks: Always specify language (```css not```)
- Links: `[text](url)` with NO spaces
- Tables: Include header separator row

## CSS architecture

### Single source of truth

**All colors MUST be defined in `css/style.css` in the `:root` block** (lines 40-100).

**Use hsl() format exclusively**:

```css
/* ✅ CORRECT */
:root {
  --warm-orange: hsl(32, 76%, 63%);
  --peach-background: hsl(32, 35%, 88%);
}

/* ❌ WRONG - NEVER use hex or rgb */
:root {
  --warm-orange: #E8A557;  /* FORBIDDEN */
  --peach-background: rgb(232, 165, 87);  /* FORBIDDEN */
}
```

See `css-standards` Skill for complete rules and enforcement patterns.

### HAP component library

Reusable HAP-branded components:

1. **HAP Note Callout** (`.hap-note-callout`) - Tips and insights
2. **Insight Cards** (`.insight-card`) - Key learning points
3. **Analysis Grid** (`.analysis-grid`) - Multiple related points
4. **HAP Info Grid** (`.hap-info-grid`) - Structured lists
5. **Navigation Patterns** (`.page-navigation`) - Top/bottom nav
6. **Footer** (`.footer`) - Copyright and legal info
7. **Interactive Demos** (`.demo-container`) - Tools and calculators

See `station-content` and `demo-builder` Skills for usage patterns.

## JavaScript architecture

**Minimal JavaScript philosophy**: Only ~189 lines total for easter egg system.

**Easter egg system** (`js/easter-egg.js`):

- Loads content from `data/hybit-insights.jsonc`
- Whitelist-based parameter validation (XSS-safe)
- Native `<dialog>` element for modals
- URL parameter pattern: `?hybit=detail`, `?hybit=formats`, etc.
- See `data/README.md` for complete documentation

**Security features**:

- No user input in HTML
- Pre-defined messages only
- Whitelist validation
- Safe HTML tags: `<code>`, `<strong>`, `<em>` only

See `security-audit` Skill for validation patterns.

## Accessibility requirements

**WCAG AA compliance** is mandatory for all pages:

- Text contrast: 4.5:1 minimum for normal text
- Large text contrast: 3:1 minimum (≥18px or ≥14px bold)
- Color never used as only indicator (always pair with icons/text)
- Alt text for all images (descriptive, not "image of")
- Semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`)
- Skip link for keyboard users
- ARIA labels on navigation landmarks

See `accessibility-check` Skill for complete checklist.

## Performance requirements

**Lighthouse targets** (all stations must meet):

- Performance: 99-100/100
- Accessibility: 100/100
- Best Practices: 100/100
- SEO: 100/100

**Optimization checklist**:

- [ ] All images have explicit width/height
- [ ] Below-fold images use `loading="lazy"`
- [ ] LCP image has `fetchpriority="high"`
- [ ] Scripts use `defer` attribute
- [ ] CSS uses custom properties (not repeated values)
- [ ] No layout shift (CLS = 0)

See `testing-framework` Skill for validation steps.

## Legal and licensing

**Multi-license approach**:

- **Code**: MIT License (open source)
- **HAP™ Character**: Proprietary (Prof. Teeters)
- **Educational Content**: Proprietary (academic use allowed)

**Required copyright notices**:

HTML footer:

```html

## Common pitfalls to avoid

1. **Don't use Write tool on existing files** - Use Edit instead
2. **Don't copy from existing stations** - CRITICAL: Always use `templates/station-template.html` or `templates/station6-template.html` as starting point, never copy from completed stations
3. **Don't break HAP's voice** - First-person, humble, references Prof. Teeters
4. **Don't hallucinate HAP images** - CRITICAL: Always consult `.claude/skills/hap-image-validation/hap-cloudinary-complete-inventory.md` before adding any HAP image
5. **Don't skip performance testing** - Use DevTools MCP or Lighthouse to maintain 99+ scores
6. **Don't use hex/rgb colors** - Use hsl() format exclusively
7. **Don't create new files unnecessarily** - Use templates provided
8. **Don't forget width/height on images** - Causes layout shift
9. **Don't use color alone** - Pair with icons/text for accessibility
10. **Don't commit without testing locally** - Ensure JSON loads, images display
11. **Don't skip Skills validation** - Each Skill prevents specific problems
12. **Don't use title case in markdown** - Sentence case for `.md` files
